# Portfolio: Mobile First Approach

> In this project, we are setting up a portfolio page with the mobile-first approach. We begin by making a toolbar and a header first. Now we add a "works done" and an "about me" section.
> Finally we are making a responsive desktop version.
> You can find the final version here: https://sebalp100.github.io/Portfolio/
